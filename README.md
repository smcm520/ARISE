# The Agency, Resources, and Institutional Structures for Sanitation-related Empowerment (ARISE) Scales

This repository contains coding scripts for factor analysis and validity analysis associated with Phase 2 of the MUSE Research team's ARISE Scales. 

The users guide provides guidance for the syntax documents created for quantitative analysis in Phase 2 of the MUSE project. This includes SAS files, Mplus files, and R files, which can all be found in separate subfolders. 

The SAS files primarily involve initial data cleaning, data set creation, and preliminary descriptive analysis. Mplus files include exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis for each scale. R files include graphical factor structure representations and item response theory graded response models for each of 15 scales.
